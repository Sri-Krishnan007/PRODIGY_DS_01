## About the Project

**PRODIGY_DS_01** is a collection of data science tasks, assignments, and mini-projects. The primary goal is to demonstrate practical implementation of data science techniques, including:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model building
- Evaluation and visualization

---

## Features

- Well-organized Jupyter notebooks for each task
- Modular and reusable code
- Clear explanations and visualizations
- Example datasets for hands-on experimentation

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sri-Krishnan007/PRODIGY_DS_01.git
   cd PRODIGY_DS_01
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   > If `requirements.txt` is not present, install commonly used data science packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. **Navigate to the notebook you want to explore and start experimenting!**
